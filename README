How to run the app:

Just install grails from the official site, and run the command
$ grails run-app
in the project folder.

Once the application is up, you can access 'http://localhost:8080/view' to get a very simple view to access the public methods of the apis. This means you can list products and make a purchase.
The are others endpoints avaliable, but they don't have a view to access them and need a direct request. These endpoints are supposed to be accessed only by administrators and therefore require an 'Authorizatin' header with a value of 'admin'. These admin endpoints are:

POST /products -- create a new product based on a json passed in the body as raw data
Json Example :
{
	"name" : "Borracha",
	"description" : "Borracha branca",
	"quantity" : 3
}

PUT /products/$id -- same as post, but updates a product instead of creating a new

DELETE /products/$id -- delete a product in the db

GET /sales -- return all the sales made in the system

By default the system will use an embedded memory database, that is populated with a few tests entry and is deleted once the application is finished.
